Docker for PostAffiliatePro
===========================

If you want to try PAP, go for their hosted version, dont bother buying their platform. It s so buggy you will waste your money and your time big time. By the way, if despite the warning you still want an easy way to install it, here are instrcution to make these comtainers work:

* first `git clone https://github.com/sbusso/pap-docker`
* configure and rename db.env.example to db.env
* put PAP code website and customization (/accounts/ if imported) in /wwww
* import data with from /data/ with sql
* then execute `docker-compose`.

But you'd rather go for alternatives, there are several new SaaS affiliate plateforms, my favorite is [FaaZe](http://faaze.com).
